## 1. Matrix Solver
To solve matrix problems like multiplication, determinant, invers, system of linear equations(gauss jordan), Eigenpairs, SVD(Singular Value Decomposition).<br>
Build in Visual Studio 2017 CE.

## 2. Geometry Transformation
To operate basic transformation of geometry, such as translation, rotation & scaling(dilatation). This transformation using additional & multiplication of matrix.<br>
Build in Lazarus(object pascal) 1.6.4.

## 3. Eigenpairs Fullset
To find solution of eigenpairs problem(fullset eigenvalues & eigenvectors) using Jacobi iteration.
The equation of this problem is AV = λV,
where A is square matrix, Scalar λ & pair Vector V.<br>
Build in Visual Studio 2017 CE.

## 4. Gauss Jordan Method

This app for solving Systems of Linear Equations 
(AX=B) using Gauss Jordan method.<br>
For example :
We have 3 linear equations
1.  2X1-3X2+X3 = 11
2.  X1+2X2-2X3 = -9
3.  3X1+2X2-3X3 = 10 
<br>
As the result we got x1=1; x2=-2; x3=3;<br>
Build in Lazarus 1.8(object pascal)
